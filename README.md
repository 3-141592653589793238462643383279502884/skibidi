## Credits
This was largely inspired from [this tutorial](https://gamedevacademy.org/js13kgames-tutorial/) and this [starter project](https://github.com/soggybag/adventure-0-starter)

The tutorial and starter project were filled with syntax issues and bugs. Solving them was part of the learning experience, analogous to inheriting an old code base.
